Updating PHP Mailer
===================

This directory contains files from the PHPMailer project.

In order to keep the Ampletracks installation as simple as possible we copy these files over rather than requiring users to install and run composer.

To update the files in this directory to the latest version run the following:

```
wget https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
mv PHPMailer-master/src/* ./
mv PHPMailer-master/LICENSE ./
rm -rf PHPMailer-master/
rm master.zip
```
